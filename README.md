# Notes

## A note-taking program

For my project, I propose to design a note-taking program.
It's features will include:

- Two-dimensional graphing
- Standard calculator operations
- Parsing multiple operations at once
- Operation log

As the program is a note-taking program, it is obviously
targeted towards fellow students, though it can be used
for more general purposes, such as writing down reminders.

There are a surprising lack of good note taking programs.
I've always wanted to make a note-taking program as a result.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create annotated notes,
complete with a title and body.
- As a user, I want to be able to create categories
under which notes can be saved under.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my notes under
different these categories.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of note
categories, and their associated notes.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete unneeded categories
and unneeded notes.
- As a user, I want to be able to view these notes
individually.
